I like to mess around with computers.

My first computer was a Raspberry Pi. I also used Windows 7, installed a **lot** of malware and got eternally traumatized by bloat.

I know Python well, I've also been learning Go since October 2019.

I've been using Linux for 4 years, and I've settled on Arch (I will probably not move in a while, Void is ðŸ˜Ž though). I've been hopping between i3, bspwm and DWM as window managers.

I've been using Vim for over a year. Anywhere without Vim keybindings is a dark place for me.

My projects:

+ asl (screen timelapses from images)
+ point (portable slide generator)
+ metro (terminal metronome, in progress)

Also, check out [Dotfiles](https://github.com/skuzzymiglet/dotfiles). They're gruvboxy.

I put up articles on my [Blog](https://skuz.xyz/) sometimes.
