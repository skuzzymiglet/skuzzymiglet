I like to mess around with computers.

My first computer was a Raspberry Pi. I also used Windows 7, installed a **lot** of malware and got eternally traumatized by bloat.

I know Python well, I've also been learning Go since October 2019. It rocks.   

I've been using Linux for 4 years, and I've settled on Arch, but I am trying to transfer stuff to Void Linux, to tidy my install for others to use. And because it rocks in many different ways.

I've been hopping between i3, bspwm and DWM as window managers. I'll probably stick with DWM, but I may try Xmonad

I've been using Vim for over a year (and Neovim for the past few months). Anywhere without Vim keybindings is a dark place for me. Works great.

My projects:

+ asl - screen timelapses from images
+ point - portable slide generator
+ metro - terminal metronome, in progress
+ sacw - an activity monitor

Also, check out [Dotfiles](https://github.com/skuzzymiglet/dotfiles). They're gruvboxy. And I'm working on an install script

I put up articles on my [Blog](https://skuz.xyz/) sometimes.
